Smartphone statistics from research, papers, interviews, books, etc.

From the book "How to Break Up With Your Phone" by Catherine Price
- "Americans check their phones about 47 times per day. For people between 18 and 24, the average is 82. Collectively, this adds up to more than 9 billion phone checks every day."
- "On average, Americans spend more than 4 hours a day on their phones. That amounts to about 28 hours a week, 112 hours a month, or 56 full days a year."
- "Nearly 80 percent of Americans check their phones within a half hour of waking up."
- "Half of us check our phones in the middle of the night. (Among 25 to 35 year olds, it's more than 75%)"
- "We're using our phones so much that we're giving ourselves repetitive strain injuries such as 'texting thumb', 'text neck', and 'cell-phone elbow'."
- "More than 80 percent of Americans report that they keep their phones near them "almost all the time during waking hours."
- "Nearly 5 out of 10 Americans agree with this statement: 'I can't imagine my life without my smartphone'."
- "Nearly 1 out of every 10 American adults admit to checking their phones during sex."
